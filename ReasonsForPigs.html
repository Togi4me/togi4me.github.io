  <h1> YOU Should Get a Guinea Pig! </h1>
  <p>If you're reading this right now, I'm going to be assuming one of the following:
    you want a pet, you want to get a suitable pet for your child, or you specifically want
    a guinea pig and want to know the pros and cons. Don't worry, I'll explain this
    for all of you.<br />
      1.)Guinea Pigs are SUPER Friendly<br />
    At first, guinea pigs are pretty shy (they're prey animals and you're very big!),
    but when they get used to you, they'll want ALL of your attention.
    Piggies will run up to the front of their cage when they see or hear you,
    and sometimes squeak. They want to be petted, cuddled, spoken to, and picked up.
    As long as you're not too harsh with them, your pig(gies) will love it!
    If you're afraid of scratching or biting, it's bound to happen when they
    are younger, but PROBABLY won't be so intense that you'll need to go to
    the doctor's(DISCLAIMER: I am NOT an expert on guinea pigs, so it may happen. Don't take my experience for that to heart.)
    <br />
      2.)They Come Best in Pairs!<br />
    Ever wanted another dog or cat, but didn't get one because they were too expensive?
    Well, guinea pigs function better in pairs or groups, and the price doesn't drastically increase!
    Piggies that are together get constant interaction when they're beloved owner isn't home, and get cage mates to cuddle and play with.
    They will also get to do some traditional animal behaviors with them, such as dominance hierarchies, and establishing friendships.
    About 2 guinea pigs can occupy a 7.5 square foot cage, with size increasing according to the number of members of the herd.
    If you were to get 1 pig and put them in a 7.5 square foot cage, and supply it with the same materials you would two pigs, it would be cheaper to get the two!
    <br />
    3.)Piggies are Wonderful Starter Pets<br />
    As you can tell by this point, guinea pigs love people, and barely will fight.
    They aren't intensive pets either, as you just have to fill their food dish and water bottle, clean their cage, and love them!
    These simple little animals are clearly perfect for young children, so long as you make sure the kids don't feed them incorrectly.
