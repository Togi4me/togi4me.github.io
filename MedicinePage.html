<h1>Pig Problems</h1>
<body>
  <p>Guinea pigs can contract MANY different illnesses. Here's some basic knowledge that should help. <br />
    Colds can easily kill your beloved pet. Guinea pigs breathe only through their nose, so when colds greatly hinder their ability to do that, it could mean life or death.
    In the case of a cold, get your piggie to a vet ASAP and make sure his/her nostrils aren't clogged. <br />
    Be careful if your guinea pig rooms with a rabbit. Often times rabbits will carry diseases that don't affect them, but are EXTREMELY deadly to pigs.
    Be sure to bathe the rabbit and have regular vet visits for them. In my opinion, just don't room the guinea pig with the rabbit. <br />
    Finally, if there is a loss of fur or cut, take care of it. Again, visit the vet, or apply AN EXTREMELY MINISCULE amount of bacitracin to the wound.
    Make sure the pig can't like the exposed wound and medication. It can be covered with doll clothes. <br />
    All in all, if you have any worries, this is just my experience, PLEASE see a vet.
