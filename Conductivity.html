  <h1>Guinea Pig Conductivity</h1>
  <p>You probably want to know whether or not guinea pigs can get along with other pigs, or even dogs and cats.
    I have a happily surprising answer.<br />
    Guinea pigs usually can get along with others. It really depends on the size of the herd, gender, and age of the pigs.
    A herd of two to three pigs all of the same gender generally will get along fantastically.
    If the animals weren't introduced from birth however, you will need to set up some precautions.
    Guinea pigs will need to sort out who the most dominant pig is. To do so, set up a large, open space on neutral territory and let all the pigs roam around on it.
    By doing so, the piggies will meet each other on ground where no strict dominance is established, and won't be cornered into fighting others.
    This activity has to continue for about 5-7 hours until every pig seems fairly content with each other.
    However, if this is unsuccessful, you can either try this again later or make all the guinea pigs take baths together.
    Rarely do any guinea pigs enjoy baths, so they'll cuddle and bond over their fear of the water.
    If bath bonding somehow does not work either, then the pigs may not be compatible. You're welcome to keep retrying the options, but some pairs just don't work out.
    <br />
    It is harder to maintain a compatible herd. This is due to reasons stated prior, as well as the differing genders.
    Males are usually the most dominant guinea pig found in a group, and like to keep it that way.
    If there are multiple males, the two will frequently erupt into battle for dominance, as whoever wins gets the females.
    Although, if another male is introduced while it's extremely young to the pack, so it learns early on who the alpha male is, then fighting will rarely happen.
    Luckily, if your herd is a happy bunch, you'll see a lot of cuddling and popcorning (happy jumping behavior) occuring throughout their habitat! :)
    <br />
    Guinea pigs can also live with larger animals, such as rabbits, dogs, and cats, as long as those animals are young when introduced to the piggies.
    Larger animals may mistakenly prey on these small creatures, so it's important to teach them that pigs "are friends, not food" to make them eager to cuddle.
    You'll also have to make sure whatever animal the pig encounters is completely healthy.
    These animals tend to transmit diseases more often to the pigs than vice versa, and guinea pigs can die easily from illness, as they're so small.
    <br />
    In summary: BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO YOU LET YOUR GUINEA PIG HANG WITH!!!!!!!

    DISCLAIMER: I am not a guinea pig expert, or claim to be, so take my advice with caution, as it will not provide definite results for what happens in interactions.
