  <h1>What to Buy for YOUR Guinea Pig</h1>
  <p>There's a TON of different supplies to buy for your little friend. Luckily, this page will help you figure out specifically what! :)
    <div class="poop">
    <ul>
      <li>Guinea pig food. This can either be pellets or vegetables, but make sure they are filled with Vitamin C. Guinea pigs can't produce that on their own, so it's vital you provide them with it!
      </li>
      <li>Water bottle. To drink with of course!</li>
      <li>Water. To drink.</li>
      <li>Bedding. This could be safe cloth, aspen wood chips, or other non-pine wood shavings. Pine isn't healthy for piggies so make sure you do not buy that for them.
      </li>
      <li>Guinea pig friendly shampoo. Although pigs do quite a nice job of cleaning themselves, they will need to be assisted every 2 months with a bath.
      </li>
      <li>Cage. Make sure you get the right size depending on what your herd will be. 2 pigs should have a 7.5 square foot cage.
      </li>
      <li>Hay. Hay really helps a guinea pig's digestive tract, and wears down their ever growing teeth.
      </li>
      <li> A CLEAN apple tree branch. Since guinea pigs' teeth never stop growing, they need something to wear them down.
        An apple tree branch will taste nice to them, and wear down their teeth. Make sure to get replacements!
      </li>
      <li>Cleaning materials. Cleaning a cage can be quite messy, so make sure you're prepared with everything you could ever think of!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    DISCLAIMER: I am NOT a guinea pig expert, or claim to be, so take my advice at your own caution.
